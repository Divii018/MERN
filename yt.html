    <P>A bicycle is a human-powered vehicle with two wheels aligned in a straight line, designed primarily for transportation, 
    recreation, and fitness. It is propelled by pedaling, which turns the chain and drives the rear wheel. Bicycles are simple,
    efficient, and environmentally friendly, making them one of the most widely used forms of transport around the world. They 
    come in various types, including road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid bikes, and electric bikes (e-bikes), each suited to 
    different terrains and purposes. Besides being a practical means of travel, cycling also promotes physical health, reduces 
    carbon emissions, and supports a sustainable lifestyle.................</P>
